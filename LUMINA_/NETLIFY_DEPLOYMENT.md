# LUMINA - Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

Your LUMINA Agricultural Suitability Analysis platform is now configured for Netlify deployment!

### Architecture Changes Made:

1. **Client-Side Analysis Engine**: Converted Python backend to JavaScript using GeoTIFF.js
2. **Static File Structure**: All processing now happens in the browser
3. **No Server Required**: Works entirely with Netlify's static hosting

### Deployment Options:

#### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Simplest)
1. Zip the entire `LUMINA_` folder
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop your zip file onto the deployment area
4. Your site will be live in minutes!

#### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Enable automatic deployments on code changes

#### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from project directory
netlify deploy

# For production deployment
netlify deploy --prod
```

### What Works on Netlify:

✅ **Interactive Map**: Full GeoTIFF layer visualization  
✅ **Custom Analysis**: Client-side suitability calculations  
✅ **Weight Sliders**: All UI controls and presets  
✅ **File Download**: Generate and download analysis results  
✅ **Team Pages**: All static content and navigation  

### File Structure:
```
LUMINA_/
├── index.html              # Main navigation
├── client-analysis.js      # Client-side analysis engine
├── suitability-analysis.js # Updated UI controls
├── netlify.toml           # Netlify configuration
├── data/                  # GeoTIFF files
├── images/                # Logos and assets
└── pages/                 # App pages
```

### Performance Notes:
- Initial load may take longer due to GeoTIFF file sizes
- Analysis runs entirely in browser (no server needed)
- Works offline after first load
- Mobile responsive

### Custom Domain (Optional):
1. In Netlify dashboard: Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

Your agricultural suitability analysis platform is now ready for the world! 🌍🌾
