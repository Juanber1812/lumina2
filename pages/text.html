    <h1>Project Description</h1>

    <p>
      Addis Ababa, one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities, faces increasing pressure from rapid urbanization and the effects of climate change. As the city expands, valuable agricultural land and natural resources around it are being transformed or degraded, threatening food security and the wellbeing of local communities. In Ethiopia, 70% of the population relies on local agriculture, representing 35% of the country's GDP; thus, maintaining fertile and productive land close to urban areas is vital to ensure both environmental resilience and sustainable development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our project proposes an interactive web platform that helps identify areas suitable for agriculture in and around Addis Ababa. By visualizing key environmental indicators such as soil fertility, pH, nutrient content, vegetation health, and moisture, the platform provides planners and decision-makers with an intuitive way to understand the spatial variations of soil and land quality. This helps determine which zones can best support agricultural activity, which areas require restoration, and which should be protected from urban expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim is to support urban planners, environmental authorities, and local communities in designing strategies that balance city growth with food security and ecological sustainability. By making Earth observation data accessible and easy to interpret, the platform bridges the gap between scientific insight and practical decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a broader sense, this project demonstrates how NASA Earth observation data can guide smarter land management in fast-growing cities like Addis Ababa—ensuring that urban expansion, agricultural productivity, and environmental wellbeing evolve hand in hand.
